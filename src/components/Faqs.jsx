    question: "3. Do healthcare providers have the flexibility to store patients’ data?",

summaries are stored for reporting purposes. All information is securely kept within the

  {
    question: "4. How does this tool help in reducing wait time?",
    answer: `Receiving prompt medical care remains a challenge for non-native speakers, asylum
seekers, and refugees. Traditional consultations frequently create a need for availability of
interpreters, resulting in delay in diagnosis, treatment, and unexpected wait times — more so
in emergencies when every second counts.<br/>
With <b>Alitas AI</b>, patients can get diagnosed and treated round-the-clock without waiting for a
third-party interpreter. Our instant language translation platform enables clear
communication between providers and patients, ensuring that diagnosis and treatment can
begin without any hassle. Be it a routine check-up or a critical emergency, Alitas ensures
direct communication, making healthcare accessibility faster for everyone at all times,
regardless of the patient's linguistic background.`,
  },
  {
    question: "5. Is there a way to record satisfaction levels of the patient at the end of the medical consultation?",
    answer: `Once the consultation is over, patients have the flexibility to express their satisfaction levels
instantly through the app. Besides that, they are also free to to contact our support team for
sharing feedback, enabling us to enhance our healthcare services.`,
